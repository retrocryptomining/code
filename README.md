# A Retrospective Analysis of User Exposure to (Illicit) Cryptocurrency Mining on the Web

This repository contains code for our TMA paper.

## Code

We provide the source code for cm-screener and installation instructions for a Zeek monitoring environment. For the Chrome plugin we used to analyze user behavior (CIAO), we provide the code we added to detect miner code. The respective signatures we used can be found in the [data repository](https://github.com/retrocryptomining/data).
