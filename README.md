# A Retrospective Analysis of User Exposure to (Illicit) Cryptocurrency Mining on the Web

This repository contains code for our TMA paper.

## Content

We provide code in the following ways here:

- cm-screener, our active scanner: source code
- installation instructions for a Zeek monitoring environment as we used it
- Chrome plugin we used to analyze user behavior (CIAO): code is in the repo https://github.com/ciao-dev/CIAO. Here, we provide the code we added to detect miner code. The respective signatures we used can be found in the [data repository](https://github.com/retrocryptomining/data).
